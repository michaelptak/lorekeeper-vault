# **`=this.file.name`**
> [!example]- Making Edits
> This is Obsidian. It is possible to change almost anything if you really want. Recommended Approach:
> 1. Always start with editing the respective template for permanent changes. Don't sweat changing old notes immediately, just update them as you go along.
> 	- There are 1-3 places the changes are necessary. 1. An input field in the Meta Data callout. 2. If applicable, a view under the infobox callout 3. The frontmatter if a default value is desired (Auto-populated by metadata input field though)
> 		- The syntax looks confusing at first but you can copy it or if you really don't understand sent it to AI
> 2. **Most** properties where you select an option from a dropdown menu, can be edited in Meta Bind -> Input Field Templates. This is convenient as it requires no changes in any template or any note.
> 	- Alt approach: Edit `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin/data.json`
> 
> Not recommended:
> - Changing the folder structure around (Hard-coded in many templater scripts. Adding new folders however is fine)
> - Renaming the property name itself (Might break some existing dataview/Bases queries. It's very doable but honestly pointless as these are not really something you are ever viewing)

## Default Properties
- **Generally come with every template**
- `tags` - Every category comes with one, but this is a good opportunity for simple, free form metadata organization. Feel free to go crazy with it.
- `status`
  - `Stub` - basic notes, no immediate development plans
  - `Planned` - ready to develop when time allows, higher priority than stubs
  - `WIP` - actively working on in near future
  - `Complete` - developed enough to be considered finished
  - `Archived` notes that are considered defunct, low quality, irrelevant, etc. 
    - Move to the "Archive" folder automatically using Templater 
- `related` 
  - Broadly link to any note if it doesn't fall under one of the usual properties.
  - Particularly useful for linking any note to a `concept` as this is a very broad category. Also great for research notes

## Universal Properties
- **Note: Not always applicable but used by many templates.**
- `art` image(s) associated with the note

## Categories (Tags)
### Notes
- **Notes** (catch-all for anything that isn't World, Story, Assets, Indexes, or Templates — brainstorming, research, to-dos, documentation, references, etc.)
  - `note_purpose` - free text field describing the note's purpose (e.g. Brainstorm, Research, Planning, Reference, Documentation)
  - `story_title` - text field for filtering on stories (optional)
  - `priority` - High, Med, Low

### Story
- **Story** (narrative planning and story development using your fictional world)
  - `story_title` - "Story Title" (e.g. "The Fellowship of the Ring")
  - `status` - existing universal 
  - `related` - existing universal
  
#### Plot
- **Plot** (story structure, arcs, conflicts, themes, and major story beats - all planning/outline work)
  - `story_title` - "Story Title" (e.g. "The Fellowship of the Ring")
  - `plot_type` - Free text field (Arc, Conflict, Theme, Outline, Beat)
  - `plot_scope` - Free text field (Story, Act, Chapter)
  - `plot_focus` - Free text field (Character Arc, World Conflict, Thematic Element)
  - `story_order` - Optional ordering for chapter outlines (e.g. "1.0" for Chapter 1)
  - `scenes` → links to **Scene** notes (the actual prose files)
  - `pov_character` → links to **Character** (if this plot element focuses on specific POV)
  - `involves_world` → links to **Character**, **Settlement**, etc.
    - This is a bit redundant with `related` - however the distinction specifically for story notes just makes intuitive sense to me 

#### Scene  
- **Scene** (individual scenes containing actual prose/story content)
  - `story_title` - "Story Title" (e.g. "The Fellowship of the Ring")
  - `story_order` - chapter.scene.beat format for sorting (e.g. "1.2.3" for Chapter 1, Scene 2, Beat 3)
    - First number determines chapter grouping in manuscript compilation
    - Full format enables precise ordering within chapters
  - `status` -existing universal
  - `revisions` - Number (tracks revision count, starts at 1)
  - `pov` - Free text field or link to **Character** (perspective for this scene)
  - `scene_outline` → link to **Plot** note (optional reference to planning document)
  - `related` - existing universal
